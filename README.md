# Recommender-System

This project is aimed at implementing and comparing various techniques for building a Recommender System for the given dataset. 
Several techniques were used to achieve this
a. Collaborative filtering 
b. SVD 
c. CUR 
For each method used, RMSE, Precision on top K, Spearman Rank Correlation and time taken for computation was calculated and based on that comparison could be made on the methods used.
